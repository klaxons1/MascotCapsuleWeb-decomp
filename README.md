This repository contains a decompilation of the Mascot Capsule engine, a Java-based software 3D graphics library used in web applets. 
The source is derived from a codebase that utilizes .jbac (model) and .jtra (animation) file formats.

Important Notes:

Status: This is an incomplete, work-in-progress decompilation. The project is not maintained and is provided for academic and research purposes only.

Compatibility: Compatibility with the the third version of the Mascot Capsule engine is unconfirmed.

Dependencies: The original implementation required asset files packaged within a ZIP archive, which is not included in this repository due to its lost media :( 
The source code was decompiled using Vineflower 1.11.2 and has been partially deobfuscated by ChatGPT, so the correctness is questionable.

The original jar file is saved here:
